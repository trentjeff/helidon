Helidon provides the following security providers for endpoint protection:

[cols="3,2,^1,6"]
|===
^|Provider ^|Type ^|Outbound supported ^|Description

|<<OIDC Provider,OIDC Provider>> |Authentication |âœ… |Open ID Connect supporting JWT, Scopes, Groups and OIDC code flow
|<<HTTP Basic Authentication Provider,HTTP Basic Authentication>> |Authentication |âœ… |HTTP Basic Authentication support
|<<HTTP Digest Authentication Provider,HTTP Digest Authentication>> |Authentication |ðŸš« |HTTP Digest Authentication support
|<<Header Authentication Provider,Header Assertion>> |Authentication |âœ… |Asserting a user based on a header value

[cols="3,2,^1,6"]

^|Provider ^|Type ^|Outbound supported ^|Description

|<<Google Login Provider,Google Login>> |Authentication |âœ… |Authenticates a token from request against Google servers
|<<JWT Provider,JWT Provider>> |Authentication |âœ… |JWT tokens passed from frontend
|===

**Note**: If the example code uses clear-text passwords in configuration, ensure that you add the following to the code snippet:

[source,]
----
security:
  config.require-encryption: false
----
If set to `true`, an exception is thrown. However, in a production environment, you would set this value to `true` so that any attempt to pass a clear-text password throws an exception.
